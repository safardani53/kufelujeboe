I thought it looked fun and asked if I could have a go. ‘Yeah, course,’ he replied.</p><p>“I was the first girl from the whole party to get involved,” says Crissie. “I began a trend,everyone was up for it after that.”</p><p>The wild night following Ed’s gig in the Tennessee capital’s vast Bridgestone Arena led to a fruitful collaboration between Sheeran and The Shires.</p><p>It’s a badge of honour to be handed a track by the man of the moment, a prolific hit-maker for himself and others. But it’s no real shock that <a href=#>smouldering ballad Stay The Night, a Sheeran co-write with John Newman</a>, appears on Ben and Crissie’s new album, Accidentally On Purpose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401571533.jpg><p>The endorsement is further evidence of the inexorable rise of two committed, compatible singers who started out as solo <a href=#>X Factor</a> hopefuls.</p><p>In country music, the pair have found their home as writers and performers because, as they stress, “We’ve never tried to be cool.”</p><p>Ben, the band’s chief songwriter who looks pretty cool to me, describes his own encounter with Ed at that fateful party.</p><p>“I was just coming back from the toilet when he pointed at me. I went over and said, ‘Hi, I’m Ben from The Shires’ but he knew exactly who I was and told me, ‘Yeah, I pre-ordered your last album.’</p><p>“I couldn’t believe it.

I did miss my flight but the relationship fizzled out. I didn’t want another transatlantic relationship anyway.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403342038.jpg><p>I’m meeting The Shires at The Sun’s HQ overlooking the Thames.</p><p>They’re still pinching themselves over their success story which began in earnest shortly after both were evicted from The X Factor — one in 2012, the other in 2013 — at the Bootcamp stage.</p><p>They’re often mistaken for an item but Ben has a long-term partner in Vicki, who has just given birth to their second child, a boy called Tennessee.</p><p>Crissie says: “Apparently I was pregnant at one point! When Ben announced that another baby was on the way, someone said, ‘Crissie, you look amazing’.</p><p>“We’re actually like brother and sister. There aren’t many male-female duos. They’re mainly in country music.”</p><p>Ben decides “we’re the Torvill and Dean of country” and reveals it was Vicki who kept him holding the dream during what he calls “the fight stage” of his career.</p><p>“I almost gave up,” he says. “Just before I met Crissie, I’d almost had enough of never getting anywhere. I was working five days a week in a shop and doing two days’ music. I even applied to university to do law but she (Vicki) said, ‘Ben, you have to give it at least one more try.’”</p><p>Cue his Facebook message — “There must be a country singer somewhere” — to which Crissie responded. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>With that in mind, I’m keen to discover the background of two singers who named themselves The Shires after counties they’ve lived in...Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire.</p><p>For Ben, music has been his life and he’s living proof that perseverance pays off in the end. “I had a record deal from the age of 17 to 20 as a solo artist and it was awful,” he says. “It didn’t work at all for me, for loads of reasons, but I’m not bitter about it.</p><p>“Then we both were on The X Factor and got rejected from that.”</p><p>His first taste of the limelight came by royal appointment years earlier when he was chosen to be a Windsor Castle chorister.</p><p>He picks up his iPhone and shows me a YouTube clip of The Queen’s Christmas Message from 1999 which begins with a close-up of a bespectacled Ben.</p><p>You hear his angelic tones on a performance of Once In Royal David’s City, at St. George’s Chapel in front of Her Maj.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/theshireskid.png><p>“I was in the choir for a long time and I sang at royal weddings,” he adds — but admits that Harry and Meghan have yet to call.</p><p>“It was a really sweet story, actually. Being a chorister was the only way my mum could afford to send me to the school.</p><p>“We got a massive scholarship but part of the deal was you had to sing on Christmas Day.”</p><p>“Hard labour wasn’t it!” inter-jects Crissie with one of her mischievous peals of laughter.</p><p>Ben smiles at her and continues: “My mum was single and she took a liking to this guy in the choir. I passed her number back to him and later they married and he became my stepdad. At 12, I was living in the castle’s Horseshoe Cloister opposite the chapel.”</p><p>As for Crissie, her love of music began with Geordie actor Jimmy Nail’s country-influenced hit Crocodile Shoes. “My mum would put on Pink Floyd and The Who and I’d be like, ‘No, I want Jimmy Nail!’ I just loved the sound of it and the story.”</p><p>While still at school, she grew to love Alison Krauss, LeAnn Rimes, Shania Twain and Faith Hill. “I used to imitate what-ever they did. I remember hearing Martina McBride and was like, ‘Wow!’ I’d just sit day after day singing, singing, singing. It was all I ever did.”</p><p>At university, Crissie harboured ambitions to be a session singer, happy to do background vocals behind the scenes.</p><p>Then she began singing in pubs and at weddings and maintains: “I still believe that if this all crumbles, I’d go back to singing people down the aisle. The pubs might be more hard work! But I was more than happy to load all my gear night after night into pubs and squash myself in a corner. Ben joined me a few times on those gigs.”</p><p>It was around that time, late 2012, early 2013, that Crissie took the X Factor plunge as a solo artist. She says: “My family were saying, ‘You need to have a go. You’re not getting any younger and need to be seen.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401300976.jpg><p>Ben, who was on the year before, addresses Crissie directly: “It was different for me because, with you, we were already together so you being kicked off strengthened our resolve. When I came back from it, I also wanted to show them they were wrong.”</p><p>Crissie says she “really enjoyed the process. I just saw it as a TV show and, I mean, they presented me as a country singer, which was really exciting. There was another girl, Megan McKenna, who was my competitor and they said there was only one place for a country singer.</p><p>“I had been 8/1 to win at the bookies. I was the best odds out of everyone, then I just got kicked out. They chose a song I didn’t feel was right for me — Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls.”</p><p>She remembers Ben pacing up and down by the Thames, wondering what he would do if she made it to the next stage.</p><p>“We couldn’t have continued because, contractually, they tied you in,” says Ben. “The hilarious thing is that less than a year later, our single Nashville Grey Skies had gone to radio.”</p><p>Five years on, with Accidentally On Purpose entering the album charts at No3, skies are looking distinctly blue for The Shires.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in music</h2></p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">THE SHIRES Accidentally On Purpose</h3></p><p>Accidentally On Purpose is out now on Decca Records.
