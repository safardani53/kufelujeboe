I never told anybody about it, not even the other guys in the band, because I was ashamed.”</p><p>Original singer Nobby Clarke has also claimed the boys were encouraged to sleep with radio DJ Chris Denning, jailed for child sex abuses in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000000589973.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000003546857.jpg><h2>Forced back on stage after tragic accident</h2><p>On the night of May 29, 1976, Les should have been on-stage in Bristol but, after the gig was cancelled, he went out in his blue Mustang near his Edinburgh home.</p><p>Euphenia Clunie was hit by his car as she crossed a nearby four-lane road, dying instantly.</p><p>“She only lived across the road from me, and I wanted to knock on her family’s door and say, ‘I’m really, really sorry’,’ Les said. “But I wasn’t allowed to do that. I wasn’t allowed to go to her funeral.”</p><p>Hordes of hysterical girls attended McKeown’s trial, screaming with delight when he was cleared of causing the pensioner's death. He was found guilty of the lesser charge of driving recklessly and dangerously, fined £150 and banned for a year.</p><p>The tour continued and Les later claimed his bandmates ignored his anguish.</p><p>“I was 19 years old, I’d just killed someone, and it seemed like everyone around me was pretending it hadn’t happened or it didn’t matter,” McKeown wrote in his autobiography, Shang-A -Lang.</p><p>I was 19 years old, I’d just killed someone, and it seemed like everyone around me was pretending it hadn’t happened or it didn’t matter.</p><span class=quote-credit>Les McKeown</span><p>“They didn’t see it from a helpful, human way. It wasn’t like, ‘We’re going to get through this together’, it was more like, ‘We need you on stage tomorrow, you wee c***<strong>, </strong>so you better stop f***ing crying..”</p><p>On the stage in Oxford, he finally “lost the plot”, he told the Guardian. “I burst into tears, couldn’t handle it anymore.”</p><p>The tears resulted in frenzied fans trying to climb over the orchestra pit to “mother” him and, when a photographer snapped the scene, Les jumped down and battered him. He was given a two-year suspended sentence for the attack.</p><p>The breakdown marked the start of the singer’s spiral into addiction.</p><p>“After that I slowly started getting into all different kinds of drugs,” he told the Guardian. “I dabbled in smack. I really went off the edge into my own private hell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6ed7f8fa-7c47-402f-91a7-43a3cfb6cc16.jpg><h2>Affair with Britt Eckland</h2><p>After the band landed a TV show in the States, in 1977, Les was more interested in hanging out with musical heroes like Keith Moon, taking cocaine, and dating famous women.</p><p>He was spotted with Jodie Foster, although he said there was never a romantic relationship, and he had a relationship with Bond girl Britt Eckland.</p><p>He later claimed to have slept with her 16-year-old daughter Victoria, which was denied.</p><p>Rifts began to form in the Rollers and in 1978, he told his bandmates he wasn’t happy with the direction they were taken - only to be fired in response.</p><p>“It was horrible. I was f**ed, basically,” he said.</p><p>Kicked out of the band at 22, with a £20,000 debt from a prolonged stay in the US, Les spent the next few years in legal wrangles with the band, which meant he was unable to launch a successful solo career in the UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000649177584-1.jpg><h2>Booze binges and gay affairs</h2><p>Despite a successful career in Japan, Les sunk further into cocaine and alcohol addiction.</p><p>Happiness seemed to be on the cards in 1983 when he married his Japanese girlfriend Keiko, known as Peko, and a year later they had a son, Jubie.</p><p>But his addictions meant the marriage was rocky with Les becoming verbally abusive to Peko after his booze benders.</p><p>“I never raised my fists to my wife or my son, but abuse doesn’t have to be physical,” he admitted on the TV show Rehab in 2009, after vowing to kick his drug and drink habit.</p><p>“I can’t believe how absolutely abhorrent I’ve been towards people that I love.”</p><p>Peko stood by him through a drink driving conviction in 2004 and drug charges in 2006, of which he was cleared - even forgiving him for 12 gay affairs.</p><p>“I’ve been a bit of a George Michael, meeting people, often strangers, for sex,” he said.</p><p>“Not in public toilets – I’m not big on the unhygienic side of things. These days you’d meet online and figure out a place where to meet – your place or mine.”</p><p>Les blamed his encounters on the alleged assault by Paton, as a teenager and his shame that he found the experience “erotic.”</p><p>“I tried to drink it away and push that memory into obscurity,” he said.</p><p>He added: “Peko’s an incredible woman. There have been times when she’s forgiven me for cheating with other women. I think this has been harder. This gay thing has been really hard for her to confront.</p><p>“She has been a big rock holding the family together and I’m really lucky to have her.”</p><p>After kicking the booze, Les rebuilt his relationship with Peko and began to build bridges with the surviving Rollers.</p><p>Alan Longmuir, Woody and Les finally got back together for a reunion gig in Glasgow, in December 2015, to give Rollers fans the “Christmas present they’ve been waiting for” for almost 40 years.</p><p>At the time, Les told fans: “I’m feeling great, I’m feeling fabulous. It’s been hard work on everyone’s part… Slowly but surely we started to gravitate towards each other again.”</p><p>After another reunion gig, at T in the Park in 2016, Woody ruled out more collaboration but Les was still hopeful of more gigs, hoping to bring in founder member Eric Faulkner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/d59bc946-bbc0-4bbf-89f0-0d5bb2bf0f4a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4e60075e-5b10-4b49-9363-e9a37b73036f.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>“The reunion was really great,” he said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The memories are still so fresh. It was such a great time. The reaction we got was unbelievable – it was electric. This is why we want to think about doing it again.”</p><p>Sadly Alan passed away in 2018, at the age of 70 and Les’s sudden death this week means all hope of a Rollermania revival is lost.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bay City Roller Les McKeown dies suddenly at home, aged 65</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpZGyBcoWScGalnaNiuqS3xKiup2WSlsZur8itsGaqn6G5pr7SZqKipJyasW67wKlkq5mgmnw%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html&title=How%20Les%20Mckeown%20overcame%20teen%20rape%2c%20a%20tragic%20accident%20at%2019%20and%20drug%20addiction%20which%20ended%20his%20Bay%20C" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html&description=How%20Les%20Mckeown%20overcame%20teen%20rape%2c%20a%20tragic%20accident%20at%2019%20and%20drug%20addiction%20which%20ended%20his%20Bay%20C" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html&title=How%20Les%20Mckeown%20overcame%20teen%20rape%2c%20a%20tragic%20accident%20at%2019%20and%20drug%20addiction%20which%20ended%20his%20Bay%20C" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html&title=How%20Les%20Mckeown%20overcame%20teen%20rape%2c%20a%20tragic%20accident%20at%2019%20and%20drug%20addiction%20which%20ended%20his%20Bay%20C" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html&text=How%20Les%20Mckeown%20overcame%20teen%20rape%2c%20a%20tragic%20accident%20at%2019%20and%20drug%20addiction%20which%20ended%20his%20Bay%20C" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fles-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-killed-oap-rape.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-02-11</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./jeremy-allen-white-ex-addison-timlins-family-album-photos.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Jeremy Allen White, Ex Addison Timlins Family Album: Photos</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./who-is-matt-maeson-dating.html><h3>Who is Matt Maeson Dating Now >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
