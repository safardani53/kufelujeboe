Leaving your vacuum unsupervised to clean your home saves you the time and energy of having to do the tedious task yourself. Using the latest technology, robot vacuums are very self-sufficient; some can map out your home, avoid stray objects, and suck up every crumb and strand of fur on your floors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"There are many factors to consider when purchasing a robot vacuum, but what sets a robot vacuum apart is the software intelligence it utilizes," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Brent Hild</a>, former director of product management at iRobot AI. According to Hild, these programmable machines can offer a personalized cleaning experience, which is designed to make your life easier when it comes to keeping your space tidy. "Software also enables various digital features in a robot's companion app, like scheduling, reports on cleaning results, maintenance suggestions, and more," Hild adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We've tested robot vacuums extensively over the last two years — both at home and in our testing lab. We let 44 robot vacuums loose to pick up crumbs, fur, and sand, and we evaluated each for setup, effectiveness, maneuverability, noise, and special features. We also tested Wi-Fi connectivity, mapping, and app features at home during long-term testing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Below, find the best robot vacuums, according to PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rdm7-QpvX6-uIeA47Mz0hCwTt68=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum-2bfb47a8ef2c488dbcefefa68da00339.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=4.5><li readability=-1><p>This product is one of the most affordable Roombas we tested.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It self-empties and is rather quiet while zipping around your home.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The super-strong suction lifts dirt, sand, and pet hair from both rugs and hardwood floors.</p></li><li readability=2><p>It maneuvered under tables, between chair legs, and around furniture with ease despite a lack of object-avoidance technology.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This product held up well over six months of home testing without breaking or other issues.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It did have issues picking up debris at the edge of the rug.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It tends to get hair stuck in the brush roll.</p></li><li readability=0><p>This does not have mapping technology, but we like that this also keeps the price low.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you think of a robot vacuum, the first name that pops up may be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Roomba vacuums</a> — a highly popular model beloved for its ease of use and top-notch cleaning skills. The iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum earned a perfect five out of five stars for how simple it was to set up, its effectiveness on both rugs and hard floors, and its maneuverability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It took us five minutes to set up this vacuum thanks to clear and easy instructions. We loved how well this little vacuum maneuvered around the space — it moves quickly, fitting between chair legs and under tables and other furniture. The robot vacuum handled the pet hair, human hair, and Cheerios extremely well and lifted an impressive amount of the sand from the testing floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It should be noted that while this vacuum had some trouble getting debris at the edge of the rug where it met the floor, the combined brush and vacuum technology got most dirt up on a first pass. The only inconvenience with this model is its lack of object avoidance technology. That's not a dealbreaker by any means but should be considered if you have small kids who leave items on the floor or pets who have accidents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we believe this is an excellent value and a great robot vacuum for your day-to-day needs. It's not overly loud, is easy to empty after use, and has some smart technology such as voice control and app connections.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong><br>After six months, the quality has not changed a wink. It's a great way to maintain a general level of "clean" on your floor surfaces, though we think you should still run a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regular vacuum cleaner</a> once in a while for a more thorough cleaning. Also, considering the tester's apartment's unique layout, this vacuum does a mighty job navigating various corners and oddly shaped walls. It expertly picks up our long hair and all the dirt we bring in from the NYC streets (although some hair did tend to get stuck in the brush roll). The only thing they wished it had was mapping technology because it does often stray into areas and rooms they didn't want it to, but other than that, it's an efficient and durable robot vacuum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $159 (orig. $274.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Works On: </strong>Hard floors, rugs, and carpets | <strong>Special Features:</strong> App control, voice control | <strong>Object Avoidance Tech:</strong> No | <strong>Mopping Capabilities:</strong> No | <strong>HEPA Filter:</strong> No | <strong>Good For: </strong>Pet fur, hair, crumbs, dirt</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ilife-v3s-pro-robot-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ILife V3s Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ILife V3s Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nyoqsXDSe6-j6WXaVU0m-qGqqnw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ilife-v3s-pro-robot-vacuum-cleaner-4c62a01ce61e474086d0f141caffedd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3.5><li readability=0><p>It was easy to set up, as it took us less than five minutes.</p></li><li readability=2><p>It has great control over maneuverability, and despite no mapping capabilities, it scoots around furniture and other objects with expert efficiency.</p></li><li readability=0><p>This product includes a handy remote control to switch on various settings while you're seated on the couch or in another room.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It was quiet enough that we could hold a normal volume conversation over it.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This budget-friendly robot vacuum was a favorite among our team because it moves around a space efficiently, picking up most dirt on carpets and hard floors along the way.

They rarely had to empty the trash compartment even though it constantly sucked up debris and hair. It even picked up all the dog hair under the bed without issue.

The TrueDetect 3D technology was our favorite part of this robot vacuum. It can avoid tables, walls, etc. by sensing the areas ahead of it. Our old vacuum used to bump into our dog (much to his chagrin) and this one doesn't.

The BoostIQ RoboVac 30C Max from Eufy is a powerhouse in a small frame (just over a foot in diameter) that automatically senses shifts in the floor by increasing suction strength when larger messes are detected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This works fabulously on hard flooring, as the vacuum can sense where crumbs may be collecting in the grout in tile floors or pick up any debris lodged under bits of natural wood. We used this vacuum in a myriad of situations, evaluating its suction against scattered cereal, sand, hair, and more. We were amazed at how quick and effective this vacuum was in all scenarios and how easily it navigated obstacles like furniture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we did notice that this model had a tough time moving from the rug to the floor (floor-change-induced suction, and all), we still felt that this robot vacuum cleaned our fibrous rug just as well as the floor. Despite this model not including its remote when the package was opened (not great, but not a direct hindrance to its cleaning power), we still had glowing reviews for this Eufy vacuum. Not that surprising, since the brand also makes one of the best cordless stick vacuums on the market.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> <strong>$194 (orig. $259.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Works On: </strong>Hard floors and carpets | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice-activated, remote control, BoostIQ suction | <strong>Object Avoidance Tech:</strong> Yes, boundary strips | <strong>Mopping Capabilities:</strong> No | <strong>HEPA Filter:</strong> No | <strong>Good For: </strong>Crumbs and other debris</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-carpet-irobot-roomba-j7-robot-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Carpet</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>iRobot Roomba J7 Robot Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="iRobot Roomba J7 Robot Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6s6Vjt233nMVPS3Lbyldkl3YPJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/irobot-roomba-j7-robot-vacuum-edf1d6373ed845e49a403bf5e7929e31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=-1><p>It has voice-activated controls for a user-friendly experience.</p></li><li readability=1><p>It easily moves from floor to carpet, which is unique among robot vacuums that are often too low to the ground to do this gracefully.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This product has object-avoidance technology.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It is solely powered by an app, rather than a remote.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This product is on the higher end price-wise.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has some difficulty finding new rooms and spaces.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The features are less accessible if you don't use the app.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sleek in design and accompanied by a complimentary iPhone app, the iRobot Roomba J7 vacuum is a model that vacuums and cleans carpets with ease (a feat that we've found to be quite rare with most of these vacuums).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The standout quality of the Roomba was the care it took to fully clean the carpet — going over spots multiple times to truly clean while also going against the perimeter of the room and traveling in a grid-like system so as not to miss any spots. We also appreciated how easy it was for this model to work on hard floors as well, and we loved how effortlessly this vacuum could pick up everything from dust to food and pet hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can be hard to access all of the features that the Roomba provides without downloading the app (which not everyone may want to do), so that's something to keep in mind. One of the main features of this model is its object-avoidance technology, and we witnessed a few messes that would have been avoided if we had used the app.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also suggest setting this vacuum in the room that you want it to clean, as it has some difficulty sensing new rooms and spaces.

They noticed it empties once a cleaning (and they live in a small apartment), so it might require several empties if it were cleaning a larger house. They also observed that it has a hard time with rugs but were pleasantly surprised after several months because once it learned the mapping of our apartment, it worked much better than when they first got it.

We used this robot vacuum in every room and on every type of flooring — tile, rugs, and wood floors. It cleaned everything from general dust and debris to food messes and spills. We also utilized the mopping capabilities, and they were highly effective at cleaning up small spills.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of setup, getting the robot vacuum up and running took four minutes (with an additional 10 to set up the programs like scheduling cleanings, etc.). That said, during setup, if your WiFi signal isn't strong, the process will fail a few times before it actually syncs. We used this vacuum daily over a month-long testing period and loved that it kept our apartment dust-free during allergy season. There are several cleaning modes, such as deep cleaning mode (which is quite loud, but effective) and light cleaning mode (which is quieter and you can hold a conversation over).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can set it to clean just one room or zone at a time if you prefer. For example, you could schedule it to clean the kitchen after mealtime so it can immediately grab any stray crumbs or scraps. With regards to maneuverability, this robot vacuum is quite nimble and fits under the couch with ease, though it did bump into our glass table a couple of times. The floor is noticeably wet after the mop mode but squeaky clean</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After cleaning, it empties all debris into a bag. The mop feature also empties any excess water after every three cleanings into a container that you can pour into a sink; plus the app tells you when it's ready to empty. Given how time-saving and effective this robot vacuum is, we think the price is valid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong><br>Our at-home tester is absolutely in love with this vacuum. After three months of use, she still hasn't needed to empty the dustbin after weekly use. “It is no longer an addition, this is a staple product for me. It is my main cleaning routine and I could not be happier about it," she raved. The vacuum has multiple modes to target specific areas that need service and as a bonus: There's also a mop feature. That said, the dirty water tank has to be changed every other week or once a month (depending on the frequency of use).

Home mapping technology can help because it lets the vacuum know where there are stairs and other hazards, as well as detecting where furniture is. You'll also want to consider whether the vacuum can easily maneuver between rugs, carpets, and hard floors.</li><li><strong>Object-Avoidance Technology:</strong> One benefit of certain robot vacuums is object-avoidance technology. These vacuums are equipped with sensors (sometimes cameras) to help avoid things like kids' toys, socks, and pet messes that you don't want to spread around your house. Models like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shark® 2-in-1 Vacuum and Mop Robot</a> are specifically designed to maneuver their way around items on the floor, like cords or toys, thanks to their object-avoidance technology.

Some special features to look for include home mapping, self-parking in the dock, and self-emptying — which the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ecovacs Deebot T10 Plus</a> has. The self-emptying vacuums do have a base that takes up more room, however, the convenience they provide is worth it. Other features include voice control and app integration where you can control the vacuum from your smartphone or other smart device. If you would rather not use an app, some robot vacuums have an included remote. Most apps also allow you to schedule cleanings while you aren't home, so the vacuum can do its thing while you're out, and when you return, your home is spick and span.</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>As stated before, another aspect to consider is the price of your robot vacuum. Often these small but mighty machines will range anywhere from $300 to $900, with the extremes on this list starting at just under $120, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ILIFE V3s Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner</a>, and stretching to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Roborock S8 Pro Ultra</a>, which retails at $1,599.99. While higher prices typically indicate higher quality and more special features, there's plenty of bang for your buck in the vacuums closer to $100 as well.</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Henry Wortock</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-robot-vacuums></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Robot Vacuums</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the past two years, our team has evaluated 44 robot vacuums in the lab and at home.

For hybrid models with mopping capabilities, we also tested these components by pouring coffee and sticky syrup on the floor to see how well the mop functions lifted these substances. We ran each vacuum/mop hybrid for two minutes and looked at how many times the device went over the mess and whether or not there was leftover residue.</li><li><strong>Noise Level:</strong> We took the vacuums home to test the noise level, monitoring if we could hold a normal conversation and hear the TV at a normal level while it was on.</li><li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> We evaluated special features (like smart mapping and object avoidance) when applicable and took note of how well the vacuums maneuvered around the space.</li><li><strong>Ease of Emptying:</strong> Lastly, we emptied each vacuum to see how messy or simple that process was.</li><li><strong>Overall Value: </strong>We had a couple of hiccups during lab testing with WiFi and noise, so we took the robot vacuums home to assess ease of connectivity, mapping, app use, noise level, and everyday performance.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-c3a52e95-07a6-4e4d-8ff8-5cee958f9f20></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.309938765897><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should I buy a robot vacuum or a regular vacuum?</span></p><p>The choice ultimately depends on the type of flooring that you have, the number of obstacles in your home, and how you prefer to clean. Robot vacuums are great for maintaining dust-free floors, especially in homes with hard flooring or low-pile carpets and in rooms with minimal clutter. Unlike regular vacuums, robot vacuums are also great for maneuvering under low tables and sofas. Because they are not as powerful as regular upright vacuums, robot vacuums are not as effective for deep cleaning and extra thick carpets.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.90033222591362><p><span class=accordion__title>What's the best robot vacuum?</span></p><p>Our top pick is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum</a> because of its effectiveness at picking up debris during our tests, its versatility (as it can be used across different surfaces), and its relatively affordable price point compared to similar models of its capabilities.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96969696969697><p><span class=accordion__title>Can robot vacuums go over carpeting?</span></p><p>While robot vacuums can go over carpeting, the deeper the carpet, the more suction power is required for the robot vacuum to clean effectively. A robot vacuum will spend more time going over carpeting than other types of flooring. If your flooring is primarily carpeted, look for a robot vacuum that is specifically intended for use on carpeted floors, as some we tested proved more effective on hardwood floors versus carpet. Our top pick for use on carpeted floors is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">iRobot Roomba J7</a>.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.94911504424779><p><span class=accordion__title>Do robot vacuums empty themselves?</span></p><p>Some robot vacuums include a self-emptying feature and models that include this convenience tend to be more expensive. When a self-emptying robot vacuum returns to its home base after cleaning, it will automatically empty its dustbin. Base dust containers can hold about 30 to 60 days of dust and debris before they need to be emptied. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ecovacs Deebot T10 Plus</a> was our favorite vacuum with a self-emptying feature.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Will a robot vacuum fall down the stairs?</span></p><p>Ledge detection sensors on robot vacuums prevent them from falling down stairs.
